My name is Oscar Romero and I am a software engineer who is passionate about
learning and solving problems. Recently I supported Scheduler, an open-source
scheduling app for Fosterful, a non-profit that connects qualified volunteers
with child welfare offices to provide a safe environment for children entering
foster care. Scheduler is built using Docker, Rails, and Node.js. Deployed using
Heroku. Monitored with CircleCI and Honey Badger. Before tackling software, I
handled hardware as process engineer in the pharmaceutical industry.
