My name is Oscar Romero and I am a software engineer who is passionate about learning
and solving problems. Recently I supported [Scheduler](https://github.com/fosterful/scheduler/)
, an open-source scheduling app for [Fosterful](https://fosterful.org/), a non-profit
that connects qualified volunteers with child welfare offices to provide a safe
environment for children entering foster care. Scheduler is built using Docker,
Rails, and Node.js. Deployed using Heroku. Monitored with CircleCI and Honey Badger.
Before tackling software, I handled hardware as process engineer in the
pharmaceutical industry.
