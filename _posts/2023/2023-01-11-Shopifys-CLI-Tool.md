I just had a chance to read Shopify Engineering blog specifically this [post](https://shopify.engineering/overhauling-shopify-cli-for-a-better-developer-experience) about transitioning their CLI tool from Ruby to Node. I appreciated the reasoning behind the change and the supporting fact for the move.

I like Ruby, but because JavaScript is built into the web infrastructure are we ever not going to not use it?

Can the bullet point for using JS be mitigated by rethinking the implementation of how Ruby was used to generate the initial CLI?
