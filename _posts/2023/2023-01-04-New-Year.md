Over the holidays I had a chance to talk with my mentor RJ and he shared several resources

First I was gifted this book [Engineers Survival Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Engineers-Survival-Guide-Facebook-Microsoft/dp/B09MBZBGFK) and will be reading it a few chapters a day.

Secondly, we discussed using notion and building the daily habit of recording my notes, ideas and projects. RJ shared this specific video [Second Brain Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs8WQh2k-Ow)

A followup would be this fundamental course to get familiar with notion that is offered for free. [Notion Fundamentals](https://thomasjfrank.com/fundamentals/) I will be working my way through these lessons and recording my notes.
