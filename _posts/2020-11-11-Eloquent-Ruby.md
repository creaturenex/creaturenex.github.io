I have been reading [Eloquent Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104)
by Russ Olsen. Up to Chapter 5 today. I find that its best to do my reading in
the morning as my mind is still fresh and less distracted.

Just some notes I want to capture while reading the book.
One example was to look in the ruby code bases specifically `set.rb`
