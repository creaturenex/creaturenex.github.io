**Take Away**
- Chapter 1
  - Joined the [discord](https://discord.com/invite/x9ZGdryVJQ?o2)
  - I will check for activity as I have made it a goal to unsubscribe to slack/discord and news letters if I or the site is not active.
- Chapter 2
  - Everyone feels imposter syndrome. it has nothing to do with how good you are. If it was easy then we wouldn't get paid and would be replaced with a script.
  - It's fun not knowing what to do and figuring it out.
- Chapter 3
  - Always back up your ideas with data. The more you can provide, the easier it will be to convince others.
  - People are not against your idea, its just that they need more data about it
- Chapter 4
  - You should try to do interview at least 1-2 times a year ie 3-4 job applications per session
  - Why?
    - Learn your market value
    - Get backup options
    - Might find an exciting opportunity
    - Keep your interviewing skills sharp
    - Learn to handle stress
    - Get offered more money/benefits
- Chapter 5
  - Learn to say no!
    - Specifically calculate the opportunity cost
    - Prioritize brutally
    - When saying no, give an explanation why you are not helping/taking on another task, ie I'm already working on task x,y, and z.
- Chapter 6
  - Never say no!
  - Ie instead of saying no, say I would love to but I am working on XYZ and they have high priority.
  - Also offer to see if they can help you prioritize lower priority items
- Chapter 7
  - Be on the lookout for great mentors! Make sure their goals align with yours.
  - They can offer perspective!
