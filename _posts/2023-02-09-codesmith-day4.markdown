Today we covered
- Data Structure Review
  - OOP pseudoclassical inheritance ie data and functionality
  - don't use arrow funcs in class due to arrow funcs not have access to this scope

- Why does these structures matter?
  - *Allow us to control how we access data*
- Array and Objects
  - native data type
  - composites
- Stacks
  - Last In, First Out
- Queues
  - First In, First Out
- Link List
- Hash Tables
  - store/key pairs to an specified array index
  - allows quick retrieval data
  - uses a hash function
  - Collision
    - sometimes you will have to different inputs generate the same value which will cause a conflict aka collision
    - Why do we do?
      - Store the data in a nested object, normally array but depends on your data
