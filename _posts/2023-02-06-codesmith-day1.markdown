First a little background info. I learned ruby/rails over a year ago and since
then I have been trying to get a entry level position with rails.
I have not succeeded, even after becoming a member of the community,
attending conferences, volunteering at conferences, attending local meetup and
making some great friendships during that time. I have had a few close
opportunities but still lacked the skills or experience to get me to the finish
line.

Since November I decided to reassess my skills and opportunities and made the
choice to attend another bootcamp. This time in person. I really enjoyed LaunchSchool
and they have amazing people but in the end I think I didn't get out of it what
I personally needed ie practice speaking technically and just the in-person
communication.

So in November I performed some research on boot camps in NYC. I was looking for
programs that specifically had in-person programs. I went to a few tours and a
few seem ok. I then went to CodeSmith and was really impressed with the program.
I was first blown away by all the free class either via zoom and onsite. They
offered a online program with videos, practice problems and an online slack community.

So I decided to apply, it was pretty intensive because they expect students
to have a baseline knowledge to be successful in class. So I had to take technical
exams to get in. Spoiler I got in, literally a week before the start date.

Yesterday was my first day and it was amazing. I got to meet the rest of my cohort,
my instructors and fellows.

I learn about using tab in the terminal to link to folder and files in the directory
I got to learn about the curriculum, the daily schedule, I will be working on a
solo project, an iteration project, then a open source project. My goal is to stay
after class each day to record my thought and what I learned today.
